name: Modules.Map.Annotation
summary: Represents a labeled point of interest on the map that the user can click on.
description: |
    The `Annotation` object gives you low-level control over annotations that can be added to 
    [map view](Modules.Map.View). An annotation must have its `latitude` and `longitude`
    properties set to appear on a map.

    An annotation has two states: selected and deselected. A deselected annotation
    is marked by a pin image. When the user selects the pin, the full annotation is 
    displayed.

    You can specify a custom image for the map pin by setting the
    [image](Modules.Map.Annotation.image) property. 

    When the user clicks on an annotation, a `click` event is generated. The annotation
    itself does not generate these events. You must add event listeners to the map view instead.

    Use the <Modules.Map.createAnnotation> method to create an annotation.
