summary: Represents a labeled point of interest on the map that the user can click on.
description: |
    The `Annotation` object gives you low-level control over annotations that can be added to 
    [map view](Modules.Map.View). An annotation must have its `latitude` and `longitude`
    properties set to appear on a map.

    An annotation can also have a title, a subtitle, and two inset buttons or views on the left
    and right side of the title. All of these items are optional.

    The controls on the left and right side of the annotation can be specified in one of two
    ways:

    * To display an image, set the [leftButton](Titanium.Map.Annotation.leftButton) or 
      [rightButton](Titanium.Map.Annotation.rightButton) property to an image URL. (On 
      iOS, you can also use a [SystemButton](Titanium.UI.iPhone.SystemButton) constant 
      to use one of the native system button icons.) 

    * To add another type of view to the annotation, set the 
      [leftView](Titanium.Map.Annotation.leftView) or 
      [rightView](Titanium.Map.Annotation.rightView) property to a [View](Titanium.UI.View)
      object.

    An annotation has two states: selected and deselected. A deselected annotation
    is marked by a pin image. When the user selects the pin, the full annotation is 
    displayed.

    You can specify a custom image for the map pin by setting the
    [image](Modules.Map.Annotation.image) property. 

    When the user clicks on an annotation, a `click` event is generated. 

    On iOS, You can add a click event listener to a specific annotation, or add a 
    click event listener to the map view to receive click events from all annotations 
    on the map.

    On Android, you must add the click event listener to the map view; the annotation
    itself does not generate these events. 

    Use the <Modules.Map.createAnnotation> method to create an annotation.
