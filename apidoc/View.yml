name: Modules.Map.View
summary: Map view is used for embedding native mapping capabilities as a view in your application.
description: |
    With native maps, you can control the mapping location, the type of map, the zoom level 
    and you can add custom annotations and routes directly to the map. Once the map view is
    displayed, the user can pan, zoom and tilt the map using the native control gestures.
    
    Use the <Modules.Map.createView> method to create a map view.
    
    All latitude and longitude values are specified in decimal degrees. Values in degrees,
    minutes and seconds (DMS) must be converted to decimal degrees before being passed to
    the map view.
    
    You can add [Annotation](Modules.Map.Annotation) objects to the map to mark points of
    interest. An annotation has two states: selected and deselected. A deselected annotation
    is marked by a pin image. When selected, the full annotation is displayed, typically
    including a title and an optional subtitle.

    You can add [Route](Modules.Map.Route) objects to the map to create paths between
    two or more points of interest.

  - name: setLocation
    summary: Sets the map location and zoom level.
    description: |
        The location is set using a simple dictionary object, described in <MapLocationTypeV2>. If `latitudeDelta`
        and `longitudeDelta` are set, these specified parameters bound the area of interest, which is centered
        and displayed at the greatest possible zoom level. This method can only be called after the map
        completes loading. Before that, use [region](Modules.Map.View.region) to set the map location.
        For example:

             myMapView.setLocation({
                latitude:37.337681, longitude:-122.038193, animate:true,
                latitudeDelta:0.04, longitudeDelta:0.04});
    parameters:
      - name: location
        summary: |
            Dictionary specifying the location and the zoom level for the map.

        the current zoom level and a negative value decreases the zoom level.

        Each increase in zoom level increases the magnification by a factor of two.
    parameters:
      - name: level
        summary: Relative zoom level (positive to zoom in, negative to zoom out).
        type: Number

  - name: click
    summary: |
        Fired when the user selects, deselects, or clicks on an annotation.
    description: |
        Note that the `click` event is not fired every time the user clicks on the map.
        It is fired in two circumstances:

        - If the user clicks on an annotation to select it.
        - The user deselects an annotation.

        The `click` event includes a value, `clicksource`, which describes the part of the 
        annotation that was clicked. The `clicksource` can be one of `pin`, `title`,
        `subtitle`, `leftPane`, `rightPane`, `infoWindow` or `null`. If the user clicks anywhere in 
        the info window other than `title`, `subtitle`, `leftPane` or `rightPane`, the 
        `clicksource` will be `infoWindow`. If the user deselects an annotation 
        by clicking on the pin, `clicksource` is `pin`. If the user deselects the 
        annotation by clicking elsewhere in the map view, `clicksource` is `null`.

    properties:

      - name: title
        summary: Title of the annotation.
        type: String

    description: |
        A long press is generated by touching and holding on the touch screen.
        
        The event occurs before the finger/button is lifted.

        The `longclick` event returns longitude and latitude of the point on the ground that was pressed.

    description: |
        There is no guarantee that the order of elements in the `annotations` property will be
        maintained when creating, adding or deleting annotations from the Ti.Map.View object.
        If the application depends on the annotations being in a set order, it should keep 
        references to all of the annotations in a separate array.
    type: Array<Modules.Map.Annotation>

  - name: mapType
    summary: |
        Map type, either: <Modules.Map.NORMAL_TYPE>, <Modules.Map.SATELLITE_TYPE>, <Modules.Map.TERRAIN_TYPE>

    summary: |
        Enables or disables the built-in zoom controls.
    description: |
        If enabled, the zoom controls are a pair of buttons (one for zooming in, one for zooming out) that appear on the screen. 
        When pressed, they cause the camera to zoom in (or out) by one zoom level. If disabled, the zoom controls are not shown.
    type: Boolean
    default: true
